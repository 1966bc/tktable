This is a wrapper library for Python of the homonymous Tcl/Tk library written by [Guilherme Polo](https://github.com/gpolo).


## How to use?

Just copy the file [`tktable.py`](tktable.py) to your working directory and import `tktable.py` normally. You could also, for example, copy the module to the `site-packages` folder under your Python distribution, so that you don't have to copy everytime the module to all your projects.
